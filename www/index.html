        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. PyLadies' mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!</p>
        <p>PyLadies Remote was established with the idea in mind to reach those women interested in Python who donâ€™t live near a PyLadies group. All of the PyLadies Remote classes will be online classes in order to be easily accessible for PyLadies all over the world.</p>
        <p>If you would like to teach a class for PyLadies Remote, have ideas for future classes, or questions, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:remote@pyladies.com">remote@pyladies.com</a>.</p>
        <p>All PyLadies Remote teachers and students are expected to behave in accordance with the <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/">PyLadies Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
