    <p>
      Put the days of trying to decipher meaning from boring spreadsheets

      all those numbers with Python. Explore the variety of options available
      for data visualization in Python using different libraries and understand
      which ones excel for what type of task. Create maps, statistical graphs
      and more detailed or interactive visualizations that can also be used
      on the web, ideal to take that blog post to a whole new level.

    Flask-Ask - Using Alexa Skills with John Wheeler
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd class="meetup_event_description">
    <p>
      You ask 'Alexa' to play songs, get the weather, and report scores. Those 'skills', as they're called, have an open API for building conversational apps. That API is the Alexa Skills Kit, and Flask-Ask is a Python framework that makes working with it easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing with Flask-Ask is fun. It's a novel experience to write and test conversational code, and it presents well over the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alexa service is available in North America only right now. However, developers are writing skills in other countries regardless.

  <dd class="meetup_event_description">
    <p>
      If you enjoyed the introduction to building a single page workshop with Django and
      EmberJS, you'll probably be interested in the second episode of this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you couldn't make it for part, you can still attend part two, we will
      start from existing code that you'll be able to download
      (you can also go through part 1 by yourself <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/ember-workshop">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second part of this class the focus will mostly be about testing and creating records
      from the frontend but we'll be covering a couple other topics as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our teacher, Emma, will be using <a href="https://www.nitrous.io">https://www.nitrous.io</a> as an online IDE.
      We recommend that you sign up for a free for nitrious.io before the class
      so you can follow along.

      Does frontend development sound scary or intriguing? Then, come join
      us for this class and discover more! Frontend frameworks are not that
      different from  backend frameworks. They are also MV*, and even if
      some of them are very different to what we are used to in the
      "backend world", some of them are really close to what we are used to
      with Django.

    <p>
      Tired of trying to check your code by hand?  Interested in testing
      but not sure where to begin?  This class will teach you the basics of testing
      in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll cover:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The pros and cons of testing your code, and when it's most important to do
        so.
      </li>
      <li>
        How to make a simple set of tests using unit tests, included basic building
        blocks like assertions and setUp/tearDown. (Don't know what those terms mean
        yet?  That's what the class is for!)
      </li>
      <li>
        The Coverage tool, which helps you track how much of your code has tests.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll also briefly talk about more advanced testing topics, such as mocks,
      factories, integration testing with Selenium, automated testing, and test
      driven development, just to give folks a lay of the testing landscape.  :)

    Introduction to Computational Linguistics with Python
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd class="meetup_event_description">
    <p>
      A brief introduction to Computational Linguistics by Giovanni De Gasperis, where we'll do
      some basic analyses by writing small Python programs.
      Computational Linguistics is a multidisciplinary research area where linguists and computer
      scientists collaborate to analyze unstructured text in its primitive form, i.e. not
      actually trying to read it and doing natural language understanding, but more specifically
      calculating statistical properties out of large text corpora, independently from the
      language by which the text has been produced.
      Typical results are: the most occurrent text forms in absolute or in relation to other
      forms, extract most significant keywords, build the corpus vocabulary. More advanced
      results are lemmatization, part of speech tagging, semantic categories tagging and much
      more.
      A text will be downloaded from the web and it will be analyzed writing small Python
      programs that can produce some of the basic results mentioned above.

    Your First Conference Proposal!</a>

  <dd class="meetup_event_description">
    <p>Speaking at conferences is a great way to get to know new people, travel the country (and the world!), learn new techniques,
      and network with other developers. But submitting your first conference presentation can be daunting.
      You might not be sure how much detail to include or how formal to me. You might even think that your perspective isn't valuable.
    </p>
    <p>In this PyLadies Remote class, we'll start with a discussion of impostor syndrome and how you can overcome it to start your
      speaking career. Multiple and diverse voices add value to all conferences, so we'll talk about how to get yourself a speaker
      mentor, how to build confidence, and the importance of rehearsal. Then we'll get into the nitty gritty of what conferences
      are looking for in a proposal. By the end of the meeting, you'll have a list of conferences to apply for, some ideas for what
      to present, and a plan for giving your first conference talk in 2016.

    <dd class="meetup_event_description">
      <p>Emmanuelle Delescolle will teach you how to create a ToDo App with Django!</p>
      <p>Here are the steps that she will guide you through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We'll install a stlightly prepared django project using cookiecutter in order to save time (with preloaded bootstrap, custom css, required apps already installed, db initialized with superuser)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll jump directly into urls.py (with explanation on how a django/wsgi app is different from basics html/php/asp/jsp based sites if part of the audience has experience with those)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll have a brief intro of TemplateView and Django templates and template inheritance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll do a complete intro on models/makemigrations/migrate</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll have a brief description of the admin and how to create a ModelAdmin</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll move towards ListView, CreateView and UpdateView</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We'll create a custom View class (to set a todo as done from the list) based on RedirectView
        </li>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p>If there's time left:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We'll do an ajax version of the last step so the page doesn't need to be reloaded when setting a todo as done and see how django can behave differently for ajax and regular requests</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Emmanuelle will use cloud9 for her class. If you don't have a cloud9 account, please <a href="https://c9.io">sign up</a> before the class It's free!</p>
