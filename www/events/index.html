      <p>
      Given the excellent performance of deep learning methods in the past decade, machine learning researchers today are slowly transitioning from building task-specific neural networks to designing complex systems that can perform machine learning on multiple problems and datasets. These systems are called AutoML Systems and is one of the thriving areas of research in deep learning. In this class, we will begin by implementing a simple image recognition task and then extend it for a more complex scenario using some state of the art techniques in AutoML. Finally, we will wrap up with a quick overview of some of the key techniques and concepts in AutoML and transfer learning. By the end of the class, you would have two coded two projects to get you started in the deep learning architecture design. The ones who shall benefit the most from this class are the ones who have some experience with deep learning methods, however, anyone with a basic understanding of the key terminologies in machine learning and a good grasp of Python shall be able to follow along.

        When you speak at a conference or meetup, you have a chance to share your ideas and meet fellow specialists who share your passions.
        A tech talk opens surprising opportunities: it can lead to more speaking, or writing for prominent publishers, or collaborating with leaders in your field.
        Your talk doesn't have to be a tour de force, you don't have to be a leading expert, and you don't have to talk about something you builtâ€”conference organizers
        love a good explanation of basic principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This PyLadies Remote class is presented by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis. He's a PloneConf keynote speaker and a PyGotham organizer, and has spoken at PyCon each year since 2014.
        In the last few years he has advanced from a nervous newbie to an accomplished speaker (but still gets nervous).
        Jesse will present a complete guide to beginning a conference speaking career: where to find speaking opportunities, how to write a winning proposal, techniques for writing,
        rehearsing, and refining your presentation, and how to maximize the value of your conference talk. Anyone should come who wants to begin or to advance their speaking career.

        This class will help you get started working with machine learning in Python,
        starting with an overview of what machine learning is as well as what it can and
        cannot do. We will use Jupyter notebooks and the scikit-learn library to explore
        how data is used for machine learning and examples of three types of algorithms:
        classification, regression, and clustering. At the end of this course, you
        will be able to run a simple algorithm on a dataset and have resources for more
        in-depth learning on how these algorithms work.

      <p>Prerequisites: Basic Python programming (including the use of functions).

        This online class will introduce you to the administration and building
        blocks behind a Django project. This includes building the admin interface
        with subsequent models and learning how to attach Rest API endpoints.
        With this class, you will build an inventory database, learn how to view
        the information in a GUI format, and also learn how to make calls to get,
        post, and delete the respective data in the database. By the end of the class,
        you will have a fully functioning project to reference for other Django endeavors.

        Excel sheets have become the de facto format for analysing and sharing
        data insights. But it is not efficient for handling data that is either
        huge or partial or both. This is where Pandas comes to the rescue.
        Pandas is a very powerful and highly optimised Python library.
        It is used for cleaning and analysing datasets. Having a working
        knowledge of Pandas helps any data analysts to quickly gain insights
        from a large dataset, and obtain a clean, portable subset of data to
        do in-depth analysis on.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this session, participants will have a working knowledge of
        Pandas. Beginner level knowledge of Python will be sufficient to get you
        started with Pandas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Topics covered:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why we need Pandas</li>
        <li>Creating a data frame</li>
        <li>Subsetting a data frame</li>

        The dictionary is a widely used data structure which maps values with the keys used to get
        them, with the requirement that the keys are unique. This class takes you through a tour of
        the working of Python dictionaries.</p>

        A brief introduction to Computational Linguistics by Giovanni De Gasperis, where we'll do
        some basic analyses by writing small Python programs.
        Computational Linguistics is a multidisciplinary research area where linguists and computer
        scientists collaborate to analyze unstructured text in its primitive form, i.e. not
        actually trying to read it and doing natural language understanding, but more specifically
        calculating statistical properties out of large text corpora, independently from the
        language by which the text has been produced.
        Typical results are: the most occurrent text forms in absolute or in relation to other
        forms, extract most significant keywords, build the corpus vocabulary. More advanced
        results are lemmatization, part of speech tagging, semantic categories tagging and much
        more.
        A text will be downloaded from the web and it will be analyzed writing small Python
        programs that can produce some of the basic results mentioned above.

      <p>Speaking at conferences is a great way to get to know new people, travel the country (and the world!), learn new techniques,
        and network with other developers. But submitting your first conference presentation can be daunting.
        You might not be sure how much detail to include or how formal to me. You might even think that your perspective isn't valuable.</p>
      <p>In this PyLadies Remote class, we'll start with a discussion of impostor syndrome and how you can overcome it to start your
        speaking career. Multiple and diverse voices add value to all conferences, so we'll talk about how to get yourself a speaker
        mentor, how to build confidence, and the importance of rehearsal. Then we'll get into the nitty gritty of what conferences
        are looking for in a proposal. By the end of the meeting, you'll have a list of conferences to apply for, some ideas for what
        to present, and a plan for giving your first conference talk in 2016.</p>

      <p>Here are the steps that she will guide you through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We'll install a stlightly prepared django project using cookiecutter in order to save time (with preloaded bootstrap, custom css, required apps already installed, db initialized with superuser)</li>
        <li>We'll jump directly into urls.py (with explanation on how a django/wsgi app is different from basics html/php/asp/jsp based sites if part of the audience has experience with those)</li>
        <li>We'll have a brief intro of TemplateView and Django templates and template inheritance.</li>
        <li>We'll do a complete intro on models/makemigrations/migrate</li>
        <li>We'll have a brief description of the admin and how to create a ModelAdmin</li>
        <li>We'll move towards ListView, CreateView and UpdateView</li>
        <li>We'll create a custom View class (to set a todo as done from the list) based on RedirectView</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If there's time left:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We'll do an ajax version of the last step so the page doesn't need to be reloaded when setting a todo as done and see how django can behave differently for ajax and regular requests</li>
